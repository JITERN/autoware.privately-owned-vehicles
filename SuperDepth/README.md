## SuperDepth
Self-driving cars require an understanding of important edge case scenarios that can occur in driving scenes. SuperDepth is a neural network which addresses this challenge by processesing raw images and predicting the true per-pixel depth of all pixels in the input image, allowing for a complete 3D reconstruction of the driving scene. The outputs of SuperDepth can then be used to detect the **object-ness** of every pixel through methods such as 3D Voxel Analysis, to detect all static, movable, and moving objects in the scene.
