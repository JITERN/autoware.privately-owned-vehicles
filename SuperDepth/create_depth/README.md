Contains scripts to process open datasets and create depth maps in a unified labelling scheme according to the SuperDepth neural task specification. To process each open dataset, the file structure and heirarchy of published open datasets was simplified manually such that each open dataset had a two top level folders, a first folder with all images and a second folder with ground truth depth data.
