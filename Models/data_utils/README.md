## augmentations.py
Image augmentation is an essential part of training visual neural networks. It helps harden the network to various noise effects during training and helps to reduce data over-fitting. The [albumentations library](https://albumentations.ai/) is used to create different image augmentations effects simulation weather, debris, lens effects, noise, colour shifting, and mixing of image patches
